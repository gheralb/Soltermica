# Soltermica
Low-Temperature Solar Thermal Systems Modelica Library

Soltermica contains models of solar thermal systems such as solar collectors, hot-water storage tanks, boilers, and heat exchangers; and models of climatic conditions, including solar irradiance. These models are intended for aiding in the design, optimization and control of solar water heating systems.

It is intended to compose a large number of solar thermal system configurations, becoming aspecific tool for the simulation of such systems. These models will focus on hot water supply systems in residential buildings (single-family, etc.) or other types of buildings (recreation facilities, hotels, etc.) including swimming pool heating systems. Soltermica does not support modelling solar HVAC systems for personal comfort.
